# Yahoo Finance API Integration for QQQ3X Strategy App

This document outlines how to integrate Yahoo Finance data into the QQQ3X Strategy Android app.

## 1. Yahoo Finance API Overview

Yahoo Finance does not offer an official public API, but there are several approaches to access the data:

1. Unofficial Yahoo Finance API endpoints
2. Third-party libraries that wrap these endpoints
3. Web scraping (not recommended for production apps)

For our app, we'll use a combination of direct API calls to Yahoo Finance endpoints and a third-party library as a fallback.

## 2. Required Data Points

The QQQ3X strategy requires the following data:

1. QQQ opening price
2. VIX opening price
3. Historical data for QQQ, VIX, GLD, and SHY (2 years)

## 3. Yahoo Finance API Endpoints

### 3.1 Real-time Quote Data

```
https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote?symbols=QQQ,^VIX,GLD,SHY
```

This endpoint returns current market data for the specified symbols.

### 3.2 Historical Data

```
https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/QQQ?interval=1d&range=2y
```

This endpoint returns historical data for the specified symbol, interval, and range.

## 4. Implementation Strategy

1. Create a service to fetch data from Yahoo Finance API
2. Implement caching using Room database
3. Schedule daily data fetches at 9:00 AM PT
4. Handle network errors and implement fallbacks
5. Process and transform data for strategy calculations

## 5. Best Practices

1. Implement rate limiting to avoid API restrictions
2. Cache data to reduce network requests
3. Handle API errors gracefully
4. Validate data before using in calculations
5. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
