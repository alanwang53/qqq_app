## Test Coverage

These test cases cover the following aspects of the application:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Strategy logic and calculations
   - Data models and their properties
   - View models and their business logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Data flow between components
   - Background task execution
   - Notification system

3. **System Tests**
   - Scheduled execution
   - Device state handling (boot)

## Implementation Notes

1. Some tests use reflection to access private methods for testing purposes.
2. LiveData testing requires the InstantTaskExecutorRule to make LiveData updates synchronous.
3. Many tests use mocking to isolate the component being tested.
4. Some tests require static test instance setters to be added to the classes being tested.

## Next Steps

1. Implement UI tests using Espresso for MainActivity and PositionChangeDetailsActivity.
2. Set up CI/CD integration to run these tests automatically.
3. Generate test coverage reports to identify any gaps in test coverage.
4. Create more comprehensive integration tests that test the entire app flow.
